# Overview

This is a large module that takes up a good chunk of space in a rack, but was designed with ease and instant input and feedback in mind. Tying each function to a piece of hardware eliminates menu diving. Large buttons makes sequencing easy and the built in LEDs make it easy to tell when each channel is triggered. 
# Design

Based on the Arduino Nano, this module features a large amount of panel wiring. The large arcade buttons make this a very deep module that won't fit in a shallow skiff. The built in 5v regulator means you don't need a 5v rail from your power supply. The large front panel gives lots of space for electronics, so as of now no PCB is available and modules are wired on Verroboard instead.

# Buy

I currently don't plan to offer a PCB for this module. I will offer panels through Reverb once I set up a shop, but in the mean time you can contact me directly to order one. They will not be full color like the panel pictured here, but rather bare etched acrylic so you can paint the panel however you would like.
