# Overview

This module takes up a large part of your rack but makes up for it in simplicity and usability. Every function is tied to a piece of hardware. Changing the pattern length is as simple as turning a knob. Large buttons make this module easy to play in a live setting, and external inputs allow you to record sequences from anything that provides a +5v trigger signal. This sequencer was designed to be intuitive and useable by doing away with menus and other software control, leaving nothing but hardware between you and control of your modules.

# Design
Based on the Arduino Nano, this module features a large amount of panel wiring. The large arcade buttons make this a very deep module that won't fit in a shallow skiff. Since this module is purely digital the current draw is very low, and the built in 5v regulator means you don't need a 5v rail from your power supply. The large front panel gives lots of space for electronics, so as of now no PCB is available and modules are wired on Verroboard instead.

# Buy

I currently don't plan to offer a PCB for this module. I will offer panels through Reverb once I set up a shop, but in the mean time you can contact me directly to order one. They will not be full color like the panel pictured here, but rather bare etched acrylic so you can paint the panel however you would like.
